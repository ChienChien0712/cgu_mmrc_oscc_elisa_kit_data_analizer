# Precision (Repeatability)

In this part, we need to know repeatability of ours ELISA kit, as this kit will be used by different operators. We need to make sure that our kit performs high repeatability between days and operators.

For the repeatability between days, we had done repeat experiments twice a day for a long time. NestANOVA was used to control the variance of runs within a day, and then we got the CV% of "Day Pass" and "Different Runs a Day". In addition, the error term which stands for repeatability in EP05 guildline can also be recieved. Our object is to find if error term's CV% is under a accetable value.

For the repeatability between operators, we had done repeat experiments several times a day by different operators. We calculated persentage of sequared different that presents the repeatability between operators.

In this demonstration, the repeatability value fall under the acceptable range (5% as usual). The repeatability between days is convinced.

In this demonstration, the persentage of sequared difference is up to 42.8% that will not be accepted.
